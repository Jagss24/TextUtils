This is my first React App ever. It is a text analyzer app from where you can Uppercase, lowercase and copy the text. Also you can listen to the text and can download the text in the text format.

## How to run the project in your system
- Downlaod the zip fle and extract it
- Open the folder in your IDE(like VS CODE)
- Go in terminal and type the following command

### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
